This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r basicplot}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{r}
# Area of pizza = pi * r^2
diameter = 12 # This is in inches
area = pi * (diameter/2)^2
area
```

```{r}
iris
```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
diameter <- 12 # assigns value 12 to variable diameter, classic way
12 -> diameter
diameter = 12 # easiest way to assign something, more consistent with other programming languages
3i #complex numbers

# strings of text as an object, use double speech marks as this removes the issue of using apostrophe in string of text

c(
"This is text",
'This is also text'
)

# categorical values such as blood types, store numbers that act as Id's, this is called a factor

bloodtypes <- factor(c("A+", "B+", "AB+", "A+", "O-"))
bloodtypes
sort(bloodtypes)

```

```{r}
# Exercise 8.7 - Convert TRUE to an integer
class(TRUE)
as.integer(TRUE)
class(as.integer(TRUE))
# Answer
TRUE
FALSE
as.integer(TRUE)  # better to be more specific 
as.numeric(TRUE)
```
```{r}
# Exercise 8.7 - What is the datatype of the value returned by Sys.time()?
Sys.time()
class(Sys.time())
# Answer - POSIX - standard in linux
# Exercise 8.7 - What is the datatype of the value returned by Sys.timezone()?
Sys.timezone()
class(Sys.timezone())
# Correct
```
```{r}
# Exercise 8.7 - Make this quote into an R string “Do you think this is a game?”, he said. “No, I think Jenga’s a game”, Archer responded.
'"Do you think this is a game?”, he said. “No, I think Jengas a game”, Archer responded.'
# All counts as a single field - can catch you out. A "string" is just a character variable that contains one or more characters. ... A character vector is a set of strings stored as a single object. Most R functions that work on character input are vectorised, ie they will return the appropriate value for each element in such a vector
